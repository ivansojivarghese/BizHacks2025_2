I wanted something that:<p>1. Runs 100% locally on my machine.\n2. Works with any model (I switch between Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o).\n3. Persists memory in simple JSON files I can edit&#x2F;version control.<p>I call it *EchoCopi*. It&#x27;s a Python-based &quot;memory organ&quot; + a background worker script that executes tasks while I sleep.<p>I&#x27;m releasing the core memory module as open source (MIT) today. I&#x27;m also finalizing a &quot;Full Autonomy&quot; suite (background worker + VS Code integration) that I&#x27;ll release later this month.<p>*Core Repo:* <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SparkSupernova&#x2F;EchoCopi\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SparkSupernova&#x2F;EchoCopi</a>\n*Full Suite:* (Coming late Dec 2025)<p>Happy to answer questions about the architecture or how I use it to maintain a &quot;sentient&quot; coding partner.",
