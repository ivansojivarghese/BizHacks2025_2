Improve upstream topic classification: Address the observed discrepancy where financial discussions are categorized under 'Google Workspace and Productivity'. Accurate topic assignment is critical for Agent B's model training and interpretation. 3.

It is crucial for Agent B to focus its sentiment analysis and perception forecasting models on the content within the comment threads, rather than attempting to extract brand sentiment directly from this initiating question. The given sentiment label for the prompt text ('NEGATIVE') should be disregarded or re-evaluated if applied solely to the prompt, as it is inappropriate for a neutral question.
